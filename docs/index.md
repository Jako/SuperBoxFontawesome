# SuperBoxFontawesome

SuperBoxFontawesome is an Advanced 'Listbox' / 'Resource List' custom template
variable for MODX Revolution based on the SuperBoxFontawesome ExtJS Plugin. The
template variable displays selected items (i.e. resources or other supported
types) as labelled boxes within the form field.

### Requirements

* MODX Revolution 2.6+
* PHP v5.6+

### Features

* Select more than one element (i.e. resource)
* AJAX based list (works fast with a lot of selectable items by pagination)
