SuperBoxSelect
==============
Select Resource(s) Custom Template Variable

Custom resource select template variable type for MODx Revolution based on the
SuperBoxSelect ExtJS Plugin. The template variable displays selected resources
as labelled boxes within the form field. The resource(s) could be searched by
autocomplete in the combo box. In the Input Options of the template variable
are a lot of options available to i.e. restrict the selectable resources etc.

It has two great advantages over the default 'Resource List' type:
- Select more than one resource
- Ajax based resource list (works with a lot of selectable resources)
